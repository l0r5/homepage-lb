# Homepage

This repository contains the code of my personal homepage. It is build with React and Typescript and uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the development environment.

## Local DEV

Fetch the projects dependencies by running `yarn install` in the root directory of the project first.
To start the development server run the command:

    $ yarn dev

The local dev server is configured to run on http://localhost:3000/.
